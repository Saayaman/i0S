# Weather App

This is a practice APP I did for class.
Features include:

- Adding everything programatically
- using UITabBarController
- adding images to Tabs
- assigning background and icon to each city, according to what weather the city is.

# Weather App

This is pretty much the same app, but I made a UITabBarController class and initialized all the tab features there.
This is just another way to write the code.
